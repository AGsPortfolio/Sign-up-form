## Overview

    Users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    - Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Please enter a valid[Field Name]"
    - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: name@host.tld). 
      The message for this error should say "Please enter a valid email-address"

## My process

    ### Built with

    - Semantic HTML5 markup
    - CSS custom properties
    - CSS Grid
    - Mobile-first workflow

    ### What I learned

    For this project is learned a good use of semantic HTML5 mark up and dived into Javascript.
    
    
     ### Continued development

    I would like to use the media queries in a good way on more devices. 
    The real challenge is getting a better understanding of javascript
